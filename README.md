# SOC2 Report Analyzer

## A Portfolio-Building Project for GRC Professionals

This project is designed specifically for Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professionals who want to enhance their technical skills and build a practical portfolio demonstrating cloud security compliance expertise with SOC2 reports.

## Why This Project Matters for Your GRC Portfolio

As a GRC professional, demonstrating practical experience with SOC2 report analysis is increasingly valuable. This project allows you to:

- **Showcase SOC2 Knowledge**: Demonstrate your understanding of SOC2 controls and report analysis in a practical context
- **Bridge the Technical Gap**: Build confidence working with AI-powered analysis tools without needing deep technical expertise
- **Create Tangible Deliverables**: Generate professional analysis reports you can showcase to potential employers
- **Learn AWS Security Basics**: Gain hands-on experience with AWS services in a guided environment

## What You'll Learn

This project will help you understand:

1. **How SOC2 Reports Are Structured**: Learn how to extract key information from SOC2 reports
2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: See how AI can be used to analyze compliance documentation
3. **Compliance Reporting**: Create professional analysis reports suitable for auditors and executives
4. **Basic Cloud Automation**: Experience how compliance analysis can be automated

## Project Overview (Non-Technical)

This solution automatically:
1. Extracts text from SOC2 PDF reports using Amazon Textract
2. Analyzes the content using AI (Amazon Bedrock)
3. Generates structured insights about the report
4. Delivers analysis results via email

Think of it as an automated compliance assistant that helps you analyze and understand SOC2 reports.

## Getting Started

### For Non-Technical Users
1. Follow the step-by-step [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) which includes:
   - Setting up your AWS account
   - Deploying the solution using CloudFormation
   - Configuring and testing the solution

### For Technical Users (Advanced Deployment)
1. Clone this repository
2. Package the Lambda code:
   ```
   ./scripts/deploy.sh --profile sandbox --region us-east-1
   ```

## Sample Deliverables for Your Portfolio

After completing this project, you'll have several artifacts to add to your professional portfolio:

1. **SOC2 Analysis Reports**: Professional-looking reports analyzing SOC2 documents
2. **Analysis Dashboard**: Screenshots of your analysis setup
3. **Project Implementation**: Documentation of your deployment process
4. **Risk Analysis**: Sample analysis of SOC2 findings and their compliance impact

## Understanding the Components (Simplified)

This solution consists of several parts, explained in non-technical terms:

1. **The Extractor** (Amazon Textract): Automatically extracts text from PDF SOC2 reports
2. **The Analyzer** (AI Component): Reviews report content and generates compliance insights
3. **The Storage** (Amazon S3): Securely stores reports and analysis results
4. **The Reporter** (Email Component): Creates and delivers professional analysis reports

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

- **docs/**: Documentation files including deployment guides and SOC2 analysis references
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for package creation, deployment, and local testing
- **src/**: Source code for the application, including Lambda function code and utility modules
  - **src/lambda/**: Lambda function code
- **templates/**: CloudFormation templates for deployment
- **tests/**: Test files to verify the functionality of the code

## Customizing for Your Portfolio

You can customize this project to demonstrate your unique GRC expertise:

1. **Modify Analysis Parameters**: Edit the configuration to focus on specific SOC2 controls
2. **Customize Report Format**: Adjust the email template to showcase your reporting style
3. **Add Additional Analysis**: Extend the project to include other compliance frameworks you're familiar with

## FAQ for GRC Professionals

**Q: Do I need coding experience to use this?**  
A: No! The step-by-step guide allows you to deploy and use the solution without writing code.

**Q: Will this cost money to run?**  
A: AWS offers a free tier that should cover most of your usage. We recommend setting up billing alerts.

**Q: Can I use this for actual compliance analysis?**  
A: This is designed as a learning tool. For production environments, additional security and reliability considerations would be needed.

**Q: How do I explain this project in interviews?**  
A: We've included talking points in the documentation to help you articulate what you've learned.

## Next Steps After Completing This Project

After you've completed this project, consider these next steps for your GRC portfolio:

1. **Add Multi-Framework Support**: Extend the project to analyze other compliance frameworks like NIST or ISO 27001
2. **Create Executive Dashboards**: Design visual summaries of compliance status
3. **Develop Remediation Workflows**: Outline processes for addressing compliance gaps
4. **Document Your Journey**: Write a blog post or LinkedIn article about what you learned
