## Subservice Organizations

Acme Cloud Services relies on the following subservice organizations:

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: For infrastructure hosting and storage
2. **Cloudflare**: For content delivery and DDoS protection
3. **SendGrid**: For email delivery services

Acme uses the carve-out method for these organizations. You should review the SOC2 reports for these subservice organizations separately.

## Risk Assessment

Based on the analysis, we've identified the following risks:

1. **Change Management Risk** (Medium):
   - Two exceptions related to change management procedures
   - Potential impact: Unauthorized or untested changes could affect service quality
   - Mitigation: Acme has implemented additional change management controls and training

2. **Access Management Risk** (Low):
   - One exception related to access review timeliness
   - Potential impact: Delayed identification of inappropriate access
   - Mitigation: Acme has implemented automated reminders and escalation procedures

3. **Encryption Management Risk** (Low):
   - One exception related to encryption key rotation
   - Potential impact: Slightly increased risk of encryption compromise
   - Mitigation: Acme has implemented automated key rotation procedures

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend:

1. **Implement All Complementary Controls**: Ensure your organization has implemented all 14 complementary user entity controls identified in the report.

2. **Monitor Change Management**: Given the exceptions noted, establish additional monitoring of Acme's change management process.

3. **Review Subservice Organizations**: Obtain and review SOC2 reports for AWS, Cloudflare, and SendGrid.

4. **Annual Reassessment**: Schedule a review of Acme's next SOC2 report to verify remediation of identified exceptions.

5. **Document Compliance**: Update your vendor risk management documentation to reflect this assessment.
