## Project Overview

**Project Name**: SOC2 Report Analyzer  
**Duration**: [Start Date] - [End Date]  
**Role**: [Your Role in the Project]  
**Technologies**: AWS (Lambda, S3, Textract, Bedrock, SES), Python, AI/ML

## Project Description

The SOC2 Report Analyzer is an automated solution I implemented to streamline the analysis of SOC2 compliance reports. This project demonstrates my ability to leverage cloud technologies and AI to solve real-world governance, risk, and compliance challenges.

## Business Problem

Organizations often struggle with efficiently analyzing vendor SOC2 reports, which are critical for third-party risk management. Manual review is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to oversight. I identified the need for an automated solution that could:

1. Extract key information from SOC2 reports consistently
2. Analyze control effectiveness and identify potential issues
3. Generate standardized analysis reports for decision-making
4. Scale to handle multiple reports efficiently

## Solution Implemented

I designed and deployed a cloud-based solution using AWS services that:

1. **Automates Text Extraction**: Implemented Amazon Textract to convert PDF reports to machine-readable text
2. **Performs AI Analysis**: Leveraged Amazon Bedrock to analyze report content and extract key insights
3. **Generates Structured Output**: Created a standardized JSON output format for consistent analysis
4. **Delivers Results via Email**: Configured Amazon SES to send analysis results to stakeholders

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Design

I designed a serverless architecture using AWS services:

- **Amazon S3**: For secure storage of SOC2 reports and analysis results
- **AWS Lambda**: For processing reports and orchestrating the workflow
- **Amazon Textract**: For extracting text from PDF documents
- **Amazon Bedrock**: For AI-powered analysis of report content
- **Amazon SES**: For email delivery of analysis results

### Deployment Process

I successfully deployed the solution by:

1. Setting up the necessary AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation
2. Configuring IAM roles and permissions following least privilege principles
3. Implementing the Lambda function code for processing and analysis
4. Testing the end-to-end workflow with sample SOC2 reports
