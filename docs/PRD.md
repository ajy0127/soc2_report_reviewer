# SOC2-Analyzer: Product Requirements Document (PRD) - MVP Focus

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
Organizations that work with third-party vendors must review SOC2 reports as part of their vendor risk management process. However, this process faces several significant challenges:

- **Time-Intensive Manual Review**: SOC2 reports are lengthy documents (often 50-100+ pages) that require careful manual review by skilled personnel, typically taking 8-16 hours per report.
- **Resource Constraints**: Many organizations lack dedicated personnel with the specialized knowledge required to properly assess SOC2 reports.
- **Inconsistent Analysis**: Manual reviews often result in inconsistent evaluations across different analysts and vendors.
- **Scaling Issues**: As an organization's vendor ecosystem grows, the number of SOC2 reports that need review increases proportionally, creating a resource bottleneck.
- **Difficulty Extracting Key Insights**: Important details about control effectiveness, exceptions, and risk areas are often buried within dense technical language.
- **Complex Comparison**: Comparing security postures across multiple vendors is challenging due to differences in report formats, auditor approaches, and control implementations.
- **Reporting Challenges**: Summarizing findings and communicating them to stakeholders in an accessible format requires additional effort.

These challenges result in delayed vendor onboarding, incomplete risk assessments, and potential security blind spots in an organization's vendor ecosystem.

## 2. Solution Overview - MVP Approach

The SOC2-Analyzer MVP will be a serverless AWS solution deployed via CloudFormation that provides the core functionality needed to automate SOC2 report analysis. This MVP focuses on:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: A CloudFormation template that creates all necessary AWS resources in the customer's account
- **Serverless Processing**: Fully automated backend processing without requiring a user interface
- **S3-Based Workflow**: Users upload SOC2 reports to designated S3 buckets to trigger analysis
- **Email Notifications**: Analysis results delivered via email
- **JSON Results**: Structured output stored in S3 for potential future integration

The MVP explicitly excludes:
- Web-based user interface
- Dashboard visualizations
- User management system
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

This approach allows us to validate the core technical functionality and value proposition quickly, while establishing the foundation for future enhancements.

## 3. User Personas - MVP Focus

For the MVP, we will focus primarily on two user personas:

### Security Analyst
**Profile**: Mid-level security professional responsible for vendor security assessments
- **Goals**: Efficiently review vendor SOC2 reports, identify security gaps, provide recommendations
- **MVP Interaction**: Uploads reports to S3, receives analysis via email, reviews JSON output
- **Pain Points**: Overwhelmed by volume of reports, time constraints, inconsistent review quality

### IT/Security Director
**Profile**: Leadership role overseeing security and compliance functions
- **Goals**: Ensure effective vendor risk management, optimize resource allocation
- **MVP Interaction**: Reviews analysis summaries, makes decisions based on AI-generated insights
- **Pain Points**: Limited visibility into vendor security posture, resource constraints

*Other personas remain relevant for future iterations but are not primary MVP targets*
