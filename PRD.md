# SOC 2 Report Analysis Tool - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
The SOC 2 Report Analysis Tool is a serverless solution designed to automate the analysis of SOC 2 reports. It leverages AWS services to extract text from PDF reports, analyze the content using AI, and deliver insights to stakeholders via email. This tool aims to streamline compliance reviews, reduce manual effort, and provide consistent analysis of SOC 2 reports.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Security and compliance teams
- Risk management professionals
- IT auditors
- Third-party risk management teams

### 1.3 Key Value Propositions
- Automates the extraction and analysis of SOC 2 reports
- Maps controls to industry frameworks (CIS Top 20, OWASP Top 10)
- Identifies potential gaps in security controls
- Provides a standardized quality rating for reports
- Delivers analysis results directly to stakeholders via email

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality
1. **PDF Upload and Validation**
   - System must accept SOC 2 reports in PDF format
   - System must validate that uploaded files have a `.pdf` extension
   - Non-PDF files must be rejected with appropriate logging

2. **Text Extraction**
   - System must extract text from both native and scanned PDFs
   - System must handle PDFs up to 75 pages in length
   - Extracted text must be consolidated for analysis

3. **AI Analysis**
   - System must analyze extracted text using Amazon Bedrock
   - Analysis must identify:
     - Scope of the SOC 2 report
     - Key controls and their compliance status
     - Mapping to CIS Top 20 controls
     - Mapping to OWASP Top 10
     - Potential gaps in controls
     - Overall summary
     - Quality rating (0-10 scale)

4. **Results Storage**
   - System must store analysis results as JSON in the S3 bucket
   - JSON filename must follow the pattern: `[original filename] - AI Analysis.json`

5. **Email Notification**
   - System must send an HTML-formatted email with analysis results
   - Email must include all key components of the analysis
   - Email subject must follow the pattern: `SOC 2 Report Analysis: [report_name]`

6. **Report Tagging**
   - System must tag the original PDF with a `report-run-date` tag
   - Tag value must be the date/time of analysis in ISO-8601 format

### 2.2 User Flows
1. **Upload Flow**
   - User uploads a SOC 2 report PDF to the designated S3 bucket
   - System automatically processes the PDF and generates analysis
   - User receives email with analysis results
   - User can access the JSON analysis file in the S3 bucket

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- System must process reports up to 75 pages within 5-10 minutes
- System must handle concurrent uploads without degradation

### 3.2 Security
- All data must be encrypted at rest using SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS
- All data transfers must use HTTPS (TLS)
- IAM roles must follow principle of least privilege
- No sensitive data should be included in object tags

### 3.3 Reliability
- System must implement retry logic for transient errors
- System must log all processing steps for debugging
- System must handle damaged or malformed PDFs gracefully

### 3.4 Scalability
- System must scale to handle multiple concurrent report uploads
- Lambda function must be configured with appropriate timeout and memory

### 3.5 Observability
- All processing steps must be logged to CloudWatch
- Metrics must be collected for invocation count, success/failure rates, and duration
- Alarms must be configured for Lambda errors and unusual durations

## 4. Technical Constraints

### 4.1 AWS Services
- Amazon S3 for storage
- AWS Lambda for serverless processing
- Amazon Textract for text extraction
- Amazon Bedrock for AI analysis
- Amazon SES for email delivery

### 4.2 Data Format
- Input: PDF files only
- Output: JSON with specified structure
- Email: HTML format

## 5. Success Metrics

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Average processing time per report
- Success rate of report analysis
- User satisfaction with analysis quality
- Reduction in manual review time

## 6. Future Considerations

### 6.1 Potential Enhancements
- Web interface for report upload and viewing
- Support for additional report types (SOC 1, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Integration with GRC platforms
- Custom analysis templates for different compliance frameworks
- Historical analysis and trend reporting
